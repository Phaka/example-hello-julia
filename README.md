# Hello World in Julia

A minimal "Hello, World!" implementation in Julia. Julia is a high-performance programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing. It was created to solve the "two-language problem" where researchers prototype in a high-level language but must rewrite performance-critical code in a faster language. Julia aims to provide both ease of use and high performance in a single language.

## Installation

### macOS
Using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install julia
```

### Linux
Ubuntu/Debian (using official Julia repository):
```bash
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.9/julia-1.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar zxvf julia-1.9.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
# Add julia to your path or move to /usr/local/bin
```

Alternatively, through package manager (may not be latest version):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install julia
```

### Windows
Download the installer from [JuliaLang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

## Running

Execute the script directly:
```bash
julia hello.jl
```

Or make it executable and run:
```bash
chmod +x hello.jl
./hello.jl
```

You can also run Julia interactively by typing `julia` and entering the code at the REPL.

## Code Explanation

The program demonstrates Julia's straightforward syntax for basic operations. The `println` function is part of Julia's standard library and automatically adds a newline character after the output. While this example is simple, Julia's design principles shine in more complex scenarios where it combines the ease of use typically associated with dynamic languages (like Python) with the performance characteristics of statically compiled languages (like C).

The shebang line at the beginning of the file allows the script to be executed directly on Unix-like systems when marked as executable. Julia's REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) also provides a rich interactive environment for development, featuring advanced code completion, documentation lookup, and shell integration.
